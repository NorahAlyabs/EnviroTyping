# Tutorials

These quick start tutorials assume basic command-line knowledge (start with the Software Carpentry `tutorial <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_ if you're new, or refer to this `cheat sheet <http://linoxide.com/guide/linux-cheat-sheet.png>`_ for a quick reference). While the guides assume you have access to a Cyverse account and Stampede Allocation, these instructions should be easily adapted to run jobs from your own hardware.
