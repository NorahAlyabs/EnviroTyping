# Sandbox

This should be a location for any type of analysis files/script using R, Python, Spark, etc.

Feel free to make a new directory if an existing one does not fit your needs.

If your analysis involved using data that might be relevant to other users or yourself in the future, move it to either the *data/interim* or *data/processed* folders.
