We develop a tool designed to add NAs to our G2F data that mirrors situations that may cause NAs in a real world setting. The user can control the proportion of NAs being added to the data and whether they are added by time interval or by variable.


## Reason for adding NAs

In previous attempts to account for NAs when testing PReMiuM NAs were added randomly to the data. In that test the NAs did not seem to affect the results, but in real world scenarios NAs are usually present in blocks of the data due to failing equipment, bad reporting, etc. This program is designed to mimic those scenarios.

## Algorithm for adding NAs

## Results after running

More NAs tend to lead to faster runs and fewer clusters.
